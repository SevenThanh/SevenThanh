- 👋Hi, I'm Johan Nguyen, studying Computer Science and Mathematics in the class of 2027 at Stevens Institute of Technology.
- 🦆 I'm leading a group of students to develop "Code With Ducks," a program designed to teach high school students programming and machine learning, instructed by college students.
- 🤖 I'm also spearheading "EngBot," an AI-driven platform that delivers English lessons customized to the user's personal background and experiences.
