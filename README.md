- 👋Hi, I'm Johan Nguyen, studying CS + Math at Stevens Institute of Technology.
- 🦆 I'm leading a group of students to develop "Code With Ducks," a program designed to teach high school students programming and machine learning, and artificial intelligence instructed by college students.
- 🤖 I'm also spearheading "EngBot," an AI-driven platform that delivers English lessons customized to the user's personal background and experiences.
- 🖥 I'll be a Fullstack Developer Intern at Contentstack this Fall 2024.
- 🏋 Every day around 4 pm, you'll find me either at the gym or on a basketball court (not 6ft and not even good T^T).
- 🎶 Can't live without music, though, I don't have a specific type; if it's good, it's good.
- 🌍 Love traveling to different places and experiencing new things. Life is too short, keep an open mind so you don't waste it.
